# beautifulsoup-demo
This repo serves as a demo of the capabilities of BeautifulSoup to scrape data from websites.

The part_1 file focuses on leveraging BeautifulSoup to collect article headline and teaser text, while the part_2 file focuses on how BeautifulSoup can be combined with Pandas to generate analysis from web-based data tables.

The CSV file within the repo is a tabular version of the table data scraped from the URL in the part_2 file. The generation of this CSV will be useful if the data is needed for future analysis without the need to rerun the scraping logic. However, the scraping can always be rerun to ensure that any new rows of data are captured in the output.
